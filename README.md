📢 Voice to Digit

Transform your voice into numbers — literally! 🎙️➡️🔢
voice_to_digit is a fun and innovative Python project that listens to spoken audio and converts what it hears into numerical digits. Whether you’re building voice-controlled apps, exploring speech recognition, or just experimenting with sound processing, this repo is your playground.

Turn words into digits — because why should keyboards get all the fun? 😄

🚀 Features

🎤 Simple Voice-to-Digit Conversion
Speak → Process → Digits. Fast, intuitive, and great for prototyping voice input systems.

🧠 Built on Python Magic
Uses accessible Python libraries to capture and process audio input.

📁 Notebook-friendly
Includes Jupyter Notebook examples so you can experiment interactively.

🔊 Easy to Extend
Want to convert words (“one”, “two”, “three”) into numbers (1, 2, 3)? This project makes it easy to train or tweak your own logic.

🧩 How It Works

At its core, voice_to_digit:

Records or loads audio samples — real or prerecorded.

Processes speech using a speech-to-text library.

Maps recognized words to numeric digits.

Outputs a clean, structured numeric result.

Whether it’s “zero” or “nine”, “one two three” becomes 123 — simple as that!

💡 This makes it ideal for:

Voice-driven calculators

Hands-free input forms

Interactive voice bots

Speech-based games and learning tools

📦 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/maghakyanyuro-web/voice_to_digit.git
cd voice_to_digit


Install dependencies (for example):

pip install -r requirements.txt


Start the notebook or script to test voice-to-digit features!

💡 Cool Ideas to Build On

✨ Voice PIN Input
Use your voice to enter numeric codes securely.
🔢 Math Bot
Ask “two plus five” and get 7.
📱 Voice UI
Enable your app to react to spoken numbers.
